# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
## How does pair programming work?
### pair programming commonly involves two roles: 
### 1-the Driver: is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
### 2-the Navigator: The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
## Why pair program?
### While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:
### 1- *Listening*: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
### 2- *Speaking*: using the correct words to communicate an idea
### 3- *Reading*: understanding what written language intends to convey
### 4- *Writing*: producing from scratch a meaningful
### The abilities you foster will serve you well in completing assignments, in your own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.
### 1- Greater efficiency
#### It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).
### 2- Engaged collaboration
#### When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work.
### 3- Learning from fellow students
#### Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.
### 4- Social skills
####  Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.
### 5- Job interview readiness
#### A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges.
### 6- Work environment readiness
#### Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
